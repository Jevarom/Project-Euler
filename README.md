#Project Euler Solutions!

These are my attempts at solving as many of the Project Euler problem sets using different programming languages. My first go at the problem set will be primarily in C/C++ before moving to Python and R. I will also try to explain any of the mathematical thereoms that are being used to solidify my understanding and explaing the course of action.
